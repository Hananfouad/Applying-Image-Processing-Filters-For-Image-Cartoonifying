# Applying-Image-Processing-Filters-For-Image-Cartoonifying-with-OpenCV-in-python

ïƒ¼	Code Explanation

I Import the necessary libraries , then Read the image using the cv2.imread method to scan and read the image. We have the real image so now we are going to apply the filters on this image ,  First we apply Gray filter on the image by cv2.cvtColor to converting the real image from one color space to another. Secondly we use cv2.medianBlur method This is a non-linear filtering technique. As clear from the name, this takes a median of all the pixels under the kernel area and replaces the central element with this median value. This is quite effective in reducing a certain type of noise (like salt-and-pepper noise) with considerably less edge blurring as compared to other linear filters of the same size to blur the image , Thirdly we use cv2.Laplacian method to convert image to laplace filter , Then apply Adaptive thresholding which determines the threshold for a pixel, based on a small region around it. So we get different thresholds for different regions of the same image which gives better results for images with varying illumination by cv2.adaptiveThreshold method , Then using bilateral filter which is used for smoothening images and reducing noise by cv2.bilateralFilter method , And Our final step We will use cv2.bitwise_and the function to mix edges and the color image into a single one to convert it to cartoon filter. Now we applying all the filters in the real image so we need to show those images by cv2.imshow and  save the image to any storage device by cv2.imwrite Where the final_image is the name of the image to be saved.
